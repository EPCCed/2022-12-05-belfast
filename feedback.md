## Shell (day 1)

### The good
 - I like how everything is step by step. Very well explained!
 - Good pace. Having the notes available is very helpful.
 - Good examples to follow with ease. Nice beginner level that everyone can follow - has tricks to see/learn even for more experienced learners.
 - Starting from the very basics was great even as an intermediate as I learned new ways to use commands I already use all the time. I'm only confident with Bash so I hope the rest of the course is similar.
 - Well structured. Excellent for beginners.
 - Well structured, interesting delivery, good help from demonstrators.
 - Everything explained in easy to understand language.
 - Good pace. Takes everyone from start together.

### The bad
 - Too fast for my level, last 45 minutes went completely over my head.
 - Some concepts were explained too hastily, while others were lingered on too long.
 - Some tasks are too basic for more experienced users. I do not think options (i.e., `ls -F`) needs as much focus.

## Make (day 1)

### The good
 - Excellent job.
 - Very interesting intro to Make. I didn't realise what it was for.
 - Thank you! Notes online very easy to follow and understand!

### The bad
 - Take more time on Make and explain it.
 - Sometimes it was hard to keep up with the creation of the Makefile. Having it in a side-by-side window with the terminal would be helpful!

## Python (day 2)

### The good
 - Thank you, very helpful supervisors, great work, useful content.
 - Thank you! Very helpful and very well explained =)
 - Very comprehensive course!
 
### The bad
 - Would be better if all exercises build into main "project" rather than being stand-alone.
